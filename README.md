# Enhancing Diabetes Management with ML-Based Glucose Level Prediction using XGBoost

## 📌 Description
This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes using the XGBoost regression model. The goal is to aid in personalized diabetes care by accurately forecasting glucose levels based on clinical parameters such as age, BMI, insulin intake, and blood pressure.

## 🧠 Abstract
This study investigates the use of machine learning techniques for predicting blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset containing critical features such as age, BMI, insulin intake, blood pressure, and diabetes status. XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, is employed to accurately predict glucose levels, with a focus on improving clinical outcomes and facilitating personalized treatment strategies.

The research evaluates the model's performance in terms of accuracy, explainability, and robustness, ensuring it can provide actionable insights for healthcare providers. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of incorporating clinical relevance and interpretability into machine learning models to ensure their practicality and effectiveness in real-world applications.

By providing a predictive tool for glucose level forecasting, this work aims to contribute to better diabetes management, ultimately enhancing patient care and optimizing insulin therapy. The model offers potential for integration into automated insulin delivery systems. Furthermore, an open-source framework is proposed to facilitate reproducibility and continuous innovation in the field of diabetes care.
